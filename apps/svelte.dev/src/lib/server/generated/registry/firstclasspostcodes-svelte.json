	"readme": "# Firstclasspostcodes\n![Build, test and release](https://github.com/firstclasspostcodes/firstclasspostcodes-js-plugin/workflows/Build,%20test%20and%20release/badge.svg) [![Cypress Dashboard](https://img.shields.io/badge/cypress-dashboard-brightgreen.svg)](https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/hu4kvr/runs)\n\nWe've designed our [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) component library to be as flexible as possible enabling you to quickly configure build or enhance any form with postcode lookup.\n\n> **Note:** This libary is also used to power our drop-in browser plugin. The documentation provided inside [README.md](/README.md) is for the plugin and the documentation displayed on GitHub.\n\n## Documentation\nSee [@firstclasspostcodes/svelte](https://docs.firstclasspostcodes.com/js/svelte) for detailed usage, guides and examples.\n\n## Installation\nInstall the package with:\n\n```\nnpm install @firstclasspostcodes/svelte -s\n```\n\nOnce installed, import the component inside a component file:\n\n```html\n<script>\n\timport PostcodeLookup from '@firstclasspostcodes/svelte';\n</script>\n<main>\n  <PostcodeLookup apiKey=\"111111111111\" />\n  <form>\n    <div>\n\t\t\t<label for=\"postcode\">Postcode</label>\n\t\t\t<input name=\"postcode\" type=\"text\" data-address-postcode />\n\t\t</div>\n  </form>\n</main>\n```\n\nFor more guides and information on how to configure and use the components, [read our documentation](https://docs.firstclasspostcodes.com/js/svelte).\n\n## Development\nBecause Svelte is highly portable _(and awesome)_, the library is **primarily used to power our drop-in browser plugin**. The fact that the `<PostcodeLookup/>` component can be exported to provide a Svelte library, is a happy side-effect.\n\n> Any development on this library must be portable, or avoid adversely affecting usage inside the browser plugin; enabling continued support of IE11 with Polyfills. \n\nThe guiding principle for developing this library is KISS (**k**eep-**i**t-**s**imple-**s**tupid). If you're developing something that seems undocumented or off the paved road, you're probably doing something wrong. **It is always best to open an issue to discuss it first.**\n\n### Getting started\nRun the mock API container, this will provide some data you can develop & test with locally:\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -d -p 2345:80 firstclasspostcodes/mock:latest\n```\n\nFor development, we use `index.html`, which is served by the [parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org). The intention of this webpage, is to provide some visual feedback for the library and allows for experimental usage. Most importantly, it is the page used by Cypress for integration testing.\n\nStart the development app:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nOpen your browser and point it at the URL displayed in the terminal. The browser plugin will not automatically start. Open the developer tools and run the following:\n\n```js\nwindow.initPlugin();\n```\n\n### Testing\nAll changes to modules should be accompanied with matching tests and functional changes should have accompanying integration tests, written using Cypress.\n\nRun the tests:\n\n```\nnpm test && npm run lint\n```\n\n### Cypress\nProvide necessary Cypress variables to run the testing suite:\n\n**Headless:**\n\n```\nCYPRESS_API_URL=http://localhost:2345 CYPRESS_API_KEY=111111111111 npm run cypress\n```\n\n**Interactively:**\n\n```\nCYPRESS_API_URL=http://localhost:2345 CYPRESS_API_KEY=111111111111 npx cypress open\n```",
