Generally, the initialized sensor will start onMount, unless you have set `startManually` to` true` in the configuration object (see [configuration](#configuration)).\n\n`initializeIdleSensor` must be called inside a component, but you don't have to wrap it in the component's `onMount` function, as it will be managed internally by the sensor itself.\n\nInitializing the sensor, will also activate the `start`, `stop` and `reset` functions (see [interacting with the sensor](#interactions)). If you don't initialize the sensor, calling them will have no effect.\n\nThere can be only one sensor per application, therefore calling `initializeIdleSensor` or instantiating `<IdleSensor />` multiple times in the app, will result in a re-initialization of the same sensor, and not in several sensors running.\n```svelte\n// with initializeIdleSensor()\n<script>\n    import { initializeIdleSensor } from 'svelte-idle-sensor'\n\n    initializeIdleSensor()\n</script>\n\n// with <IdleSensor />\n<script>\n    import { IdleSensor } from 'svelte-idle-sensor'\n</script>\n<IdleSensor />\n\n```\n### <a id=\"configuration\"></a>Configure the sensor\nThe sensor come with a default configuration, which you can personalize on its initialization.\nYou can do it either via a configuration object passed as a parameter to `initializeIdleSensor`, or via optional props passed to `<IdleSensor />`.\nThe options, all of which are non-mandatory as they all have a default value, are:\n\n- **idleTimeout**: `number`; time of user's inactivity in milliseconds before the idle status changes to idle. This time is extended by the `reminderDuration` option. Triggering any of the events observed by the sensor (see the option events below), will reset the timer. It defaults to 15 minutes.\n- **reminderDuration**: `number`; additional time slot after the idle timer expires, before declaring the user idle and calling the idle callback. This is to meet the use case when we may want to prompt the user to check if they are still active before declaring them idle, or to remind them that they will be logged out shortly. Events triggered in this phase won't stop the timer, only the reset and stop methods will (see [Interacting with the sensor](#interactions)). It defaults to 0.\n- **onIdle | on:idle**: `(idleEvt: CustomEvent<{ lastFiredEvent: Event }>) => void`; callback triggered when the user status passes to idle. When invoked, an `IdleEvent`, storing in its `detail` the last event fired before the reminding phase, will be passed as a parameter. Events fired in the prompt phase will not call this callback. It defaults to an empty function.\n- **onRemind | on:remind**: `(remindEvt: CustomEvent<{ lastFiredEvent: Event }>) => void`; when the `idleTimeout` expires, before declaring the idle status, the remind callback is fired, starting the reminder timer. When invoked, a `RemindEvent`, storing in its `detail` the last event fired before the reminding phase, will be passed as a parameter. It defaults to an empty function.\n- **onActive | on:active**: `(activityEvt: CustomEvent<{ triggeringEvent: Event }>) => void`; callback called when the user resumes activity after having been idle (resuming from the reminding phase doesn't trigger `onActive`). An `ActivityEvent`, storing the event that triggered the return to activity in its `detail`, is passed as a parameter. It defaults to an empty function.\n- **startManually**: `boolean`; requires the event listeners to be bound manually by using the `start` method, instead of doing it automatically on the component's mount. It defaults to false.\n- **events**: `EventTypeName[]`; a list of the DOM events that will be listened to in order to monitor the user's activity. The events must be of `EventTypeName` type (this type can be imported). The list defaults to `['mousemove', 'keydown', 'wheel', 'resize', 'mousewheel', 'mousedown', 'pointerdown', 'touchstart', 'touchmove', 'visibilitychange']`\n- **multitabSensor**: `strings`; coordinates sensors that are open on different tabs. This configuration option is to meet the case when the user is working on a tab, while another instance of the sensor is running on another one: coordinating the sensors will prevent the inactive tab to fire any idle callback that will affect the tab currently in use too (e.g. disconnecting the user). To activate the option, you have to pass a string (any short key identifying the page/app) that will be used to name the channel (it relies on the BroadcastChannel API under the hood) used by the sensors to communicate. With `multitabSensor` active, there will be only one active sensor at a time, and it will be the one in the tab the user has most recently interacted with, called the main tab; when another tab becomes the main one, the other sensors are stopped. If a tab becomes the main tab again, its sensor is restarted, unless `startManually` is set to `true`. Closing the main tab will result in one of the other tabs being chosen randomly as the main one in about 1.5 seconds (unless any other event occurs meanwhile). Activating this option will make the `onTabActivity | on:tabActivity` available. It defaults to `undefined`.\n- **onTabActivity | on:tabActivity**: `(tabActivityEvt: CustomEvent<{ isMainTab: boolean }>) => void`; callback called when a change of tab is detected (e.g. a new instance of the sensor is open in a different tab). A `TabActivityEvent` storing an `isMainTab: boolean` property in its `detail`, is passed as a parameter. It defaults to an empty function.\n\n## <a id='interactions'></a>Interacting with the sensor\nTo interact with the sensor, in addition to passing different configuration callbacks, `idle-sensor` provides several stores and methods.\n- **idle** and **reminding**: `Readable<boolean>`; these two readable stores report the user status. They do not concur.\n- **start**, **stop** and **reset**: `() => void`; allow respectively to start, stop and reset the sensor. `start` and `reset`, create a custom `manualstart` and `manualreset` event, that will be stored by stored as `lastFiredEvent` by the `idle` and `remind` events passsed to the `onIdle` and `onRemind` callbacks if no other activity occurs (there's another custom event, `mount`, created when timers start automatically). Finally, `stop` and `reset` don't trigger `onActive`.\n\nThese can be imported directly from `svelte-idle-sensor`, regardless of whether the sensor has been initialized by `` or component.\nOnce the sensor has been initialized, you can import them anywhere in the app and they'll be working, thanks to Svelte stores' properties.\n\nFinally, `idle`, `remind`, `start`, `stop`, and `reset`, are also returned by `initializeIdleSensor`\n\n```svelte\n// named import\n<script>\n    import { idle, remind, start, stop, reset } from 'svelte-idle-sensor'\n    // do something\n</script>\n\n// with initializeIdleSensor()\n<script>\n    import { initializeIdleSensor } from 'svelte-idle-sensor'\n\n    const { idle, remind, start, stop, reset } = initializeIdleSensor()\n    // do something\n</script>\n\n```\n\n## Acknowledgments\nThis library is inspired by [react-idle-timer](https://idletimer.dev/)",
