	"readme": "# @small-tech/svelte-nano-donate\n\nA [Nano](https://nano.org) donation component built using Svelte.\n\n⯈ [Live demo](https://small-tech.org/demo/svelte-nano-donate/)\n\n___Note:__ you can [use this component in any web project](#use-in-non-svelte-apps), you __do not__ need to use Svelte yourself._\n\n## Install\n\n```shell\nnpm i @small-tech/svelte-nano-donate\n```\n\n## Use (in Svelte apps)\n\nSimply import and use the component.\n\nAll you need to use the component is the Nano address you want to receive donations into:\n\n```html\n<script>\n  import Donate from '@small-tech/svelte-nano-donate'\n</script>\n\n<Donate address=nano_1hfmyyjtm4muiudw1m8dz54jry13jx8xykp9kz1mx3uqe4dtsb3yrdkjgy6g/>\n```\n\nYou can also customise the component by specifying properties like the initial `amount` and `currency` that’s displayed. And you even specify a theme to customise how the component looks:\n\n```html\n<script>\n  import Donate from '@small-tech/svelte-nano-donate'\n</script>\n\n<main>\n  <Donate\n    amount=5\n    currency=usd\n    address=nano_1hfmyyjtm4muiudw1m8dz54jry13jx8xykp9kz1mx3uqe4dtsb3yrdkjgy6g\n    theme={{colour: '#0062cc'}}\n  />\n</main>\n```\n\nHere’s [a live demo of this example built using SvelteKit](https://small-tech.org/demo/svelte-nano-donate) ([source code](https://github.com/small-tech/svelte-nano-donate-demo/)).\n\nThe `colour` value specified here will be used for the text. Also, the `border-colour` of form elements will automatically be calculated as a lighter tint of this colour, unless you specify that property explicitly.\n\n> _Please make sure you check the contrast ratio of the colours you choose for accessibility. You can do so using [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/)’s [online contrast ratio tool](https://contrast-ratio.com) or, if you want to use an eyedropper tool to sample colours, a native app for your platform like [Daniel Foré](https://github.com/danrabbit)’s excellent [Harvey ](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.danrabbit.harvey/) on [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/))._\n\nThe component comes with automatic dark mode support.\n\nFor the full list of theme properties, please see the [Theming](#theming) section.\n\n## Use (in non-Svelte apps)\n\nYou can `require()` or `import()` the component in your projects as it is simply a regular JavaScript class.\n\nTo use it, instantiate the class and pass it an options object that contains the DOM element that you want the class to bind to any properties you want to include (only the `address` property is required). The plain HTML and JavaScript snippet below is functionally equivalent to the Svelte version, above.\n\n```html\n<main>\n  <div id='nano-donate'></div>\n\n  <script type='module'>\n    import NanoDonate from '@small-tech/svelte-nano-donate'\n\n    const nanoDonate = new NanoDonate({\n      target: document.getElementById('nano-donate'),\n      props: {\n        amount: 5,\n        currency: 'usd',\n        address: 'nano_1hfmyyjtm4muiudw1m8dz54jry13jx8xykp9kz1mx3uqe4dtsb3yrdkjgy6g',\n        theme: {colour: '#4A90E2'}\n      }\n    })\n  </script>\n</main>\n```\n\nThis example is included in the _example/_ folder. Run it in a local server (e.g., using [Site.js](https://sitejs.org)) to see it in action.\n\n## Theming\n\nBy default, you get a theme with light and dark modes.\n\nYou can also apply an entirely custom theme to the component by passing an object to the `theme` property.\n\nThe list of valid colour names for a custom `theme` object are shown here and they map to the CSS variables used in the component:\n\n| Name                | Default            | Used for                                          |\n| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| `colour`            | `rgb(48, 67, 73)`  | Text in form elements and links                   |\n| `border-colour`     | `rgb(183,186,188)` | Borders of form elements; 50% lighter than colour |\n| `background-colour` | `white`            | Component background                              |\n\nIf you don’t explicitly pass a custom `border-colour` value, it will be calculated automatically from the value of the `colour` property. _Note that for this automatic calculation to succeed, you must specify the value of the `colour` property in either rgb(a) or hex format (not as a CSS colour name)._\n\n> _Please make sure you check the contrast ratio of the colours you choose for accessibility. You can do so using [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/)’s [online contrast ratio tool](https://contrast-ratio.com) or, if you want to use an eyedropper tool to sample colours, a native app for your platform like [Daniel Foré](https://github.com/danrabbit)’s excellent [Harvey ](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.danrabbit.harvey/) on [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/))._\n\n\n## Develop\n\nTo contribute to the development of this component, please use the discussion feature on GitHub to discuss any changes/improvements you want to make and open issues if you notice any bugs before working on a feature/fix and submitting a pull request.\n\n### Build\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis will output an ECMAScript module and a UMD script in the `dist` folder. The build script runs automatically via the `prepublishOnly` hook in package.json when publishing to npm.\n\n## Like this?
