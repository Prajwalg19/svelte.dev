	"readme": "# svelte-adapter\n\nA simple utility that allows you to use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) components inside [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) components.\n\nThere is an adapter each for Vue and React which allows you to pass props and respond to events in a way that makes sense for that library.\n\nThis isn't a perfect solution, there are some limitations.\n\n---\n\n- [Install](#install)\n- [Use it](#use-it)\n- [Examples](#examples)\n  - [React](#react)\n  - [Vue](#vue)\n- [Limitations](#limitations)\n\n# Install\n\nWith [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```bash\nnpm install svelte-adapter\n```\n\nOr with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/):\n\n```bash\nyarn add svelte-adapter\n```\n\n# Use it\n\nEach 'adapter' is a simple function that takes a svelte component and a few options and returns a Vue or React component that can be used in Vue templates or JSX as you would expect. The returned components will always have a wrapper element, by default this is a `<span>` but it can be customised.\n\nThe adapters both have the same signature:\n\n```ts\nadapter(Component: SvelteComponent, styleObject?: object, wrapperElement?: string) : Component\n```\n\n- `Component` should be a _compiled_ svelte component, either precompiled or compiled as part of your build step using `rollup-plugin-svelte` for rollup or `svelte-loader` from webpack.\n- `styleObject` (optional) should be an object of styles that will be applied to the base elemement. This should be a valid JavaScript object with camelCased css property names. This defaults to an empty object.\n- `wrapperElement` (optional). All component have a base 'wrapper' element, by default this is a `<span>` but you can pass in a string to customise this behaviour (eg: `'div'`, `'li'`, etc.) If need a specific wrapper element but don't care about styles, you can simply pass an empty object as the `styleObject`.\n\nIn the examples below, the Svelte component we will be using is a simple component that accepts a prop that will be rendered and emits an event upon clicking a button.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n  import { createEventDispatcher } from 'svelte';\n\n  export let number = 0;\n  const dispatch = createEventDispatcher();\n</script>\n\n<h1>{ number }</h1>\n<button on:click={ () => dispatch('magicalclick') }>\n  Click Me\n</button>\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### React\n\n[Try it on codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/svelte-adapterreact-8s33k)\n\nThe React-Svelte adapter is the default export from `svelte-adpater/react`.\n\nThe implementation of the React adapter uses [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) so you will need a recent version of React for this to work. If necessary I could add a class-based version at some stage.\n\nUsing the adaptor is very straight-forward, the adapter is a Higher Order Component that takes a Svelte component and returns a React component. The below example assumes your are compiling Svelte components as they are imported using webpack or rollup. If not, just import the compiled javascript file instead.\n\nSvelte components can emit events which doesn't quite make sense in React. Any events emitted by the svelte component can be passed callbacks via an `on*` prop containing a function, this function will fire when the event is emitted. Any prop that starts with `on` followed by a capital letter is assumed to be an event and will be used to add a listener. `onClick` will fire the provided callback when `'click'` events are emitted, `onSomethingRandom` will do the same for `'somethingRandom'` events. This does not interfere with props that have the same naming convention, they will all be passed regardless.\n\nSome Svelte component's allow you to `bind` to internal data which doesn't make too much sense outside of Svelte yet they often form an important part of the API. Instead I have added the option to use a `watch*` prop (similar to the `on*` prop). This also takes a callback function and recieves the value you wish to watch as its only argument. `watchNumber={ n => setCount(n) }` would watch the internal value `number`, when `number` changes the callback you passed to it would be executed receiving the new `number` value as its only argument.\n\nThis may seem strange but many Svelte components are written to make use of this `bind` syntax, without it there is often a hole in the API leaving you unable to respond to internal state changes. You will probably want to control your state with React, this `watch*` prop is an escape hatch that allows you to pull out those internal values to use however you wish.\n\nNormal props behave as you would expect.\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\nimport toReact from \"svelte-adapter/react\";\n\nimport SvelteApp from \"../App.svelte\";\n\nconst baseStyle = {\n  width: \"50%\"\n};\n\nconst SvelteInReact = toReact(SvelteApp, baseStyle, \"div\");\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(10);\n\n  const handleClick = () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <SvelteInReact\n        number={count}\n        onMagicalclick={handleClick}\n        watchNumber={n => setCount(n)}\n      />\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment - {count}</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Vue\n\n[Try it on codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/svelte-adaptervue-40uwg)\n\nThe Vue-Svelte adapter is the default export from `svelte-adpater/vue`.\n\nUsing the adapter is very straight-forward, the adapter is a Higher Order Component that takes a Svelte component and returns a Vue component. The below example assumes your are compiling Svelte components as they are imported using webpack or rollup. If not, just import the compiled javascript file instead.\n\nSince Vue has an event mechanism similar to Svelte, event directives can be used as expected. `v-on:*` or `@*` directives will listen for the matching events on the Svelte component. `v-on:click` or `@click` will fire the provided callback when `'click'` events are emitted, `v-on:somethingRandom` or `@somethingrandom` will do the same for `'somethingRandom'` events. Other props behave as you would expect.\n\nSome Svelte component's allow you to `bind` to internal data which doesn't make too much sense outside of Svelte yet they often form an important part of the API. I have added the option to use a `@watch:*` prop (similar to the `@:*` prop). This also takes a callback function and recieves the value you wish to watch as its only argument. `@watch:number=\"setCount\"` would watch the internal value `number`, when `number` changes the callback you passed to it would be executed receiving the new `number` value as its only argument.\n\nThis may seem strange but many Svelte components are written to make use of this `bind` syntax, without it there is often a hole in the API leaving you unable to respond to internal state changes. You will probably want to control your state in a Vue component, this `@watch:*` prop is an escape hatch that allows you to pull out those internal values to use however you wish.\n\nNormal props behave as expected.\n\n```vue\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <SvelteInVue\n      :number=\"count\"\n      @magicalclick=\"handleClick\"\n      @watch:number=\"setCount\"\n    />\n    <button @click=\"handleClick\">Increment - {{ count }}</button>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport SvelteApp from \"../App.svelte\";\nimport toVue from \"svelte-adapter/vue\";\n\nconst baseStyle = {\n  width: \"50%\"\n};\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    SvelteInVue: toVue(SvelteApp, baseStyle, \"div\")\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    };\n  },\n  methods: {\n    handleClick() {\n      this.count += 1;\n    },\n    setCount(n) {\n      this.count = n;\n    }\n  }\n};\n</script>\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhile everything should work in most situations, it is not currently possible to pass children or slots to Svelte components with these adapters.\n\nThis won't work with any of the adpaters:\n\n```html\n<SvelteComponent>\n  <p>Hello</p>\n</SvelteComponent>\n```\n\nThere may be more limitations that I am unaware of, this package is really just intended a simple way to use Svelte and should work most of the time. The code is short and simple, if you have specific needs you will probably be better off writing something custom for your application.\n",
