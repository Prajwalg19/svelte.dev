	"readme": "# svelte-search-spotify\n\nA thing to put in your Svelte app to allow users to search via the Spotify API.\n\nNote: Only tested for tracks so far.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install svelte-search-spotify\n\n## Usage\n\n    <script>\n    import SearchSpotify from 'svelte-search-spotify';\n\n    let error;\n\n    function setError(anError) {\n      error = anError;\n    }\n\n    function onResultClick(result) {\n      console.log('The user picked', result);\n      // Do something with the result.\n    }\n\n    // Do stuff to get yourself a token (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)\n    </script>\n\n    <div>\n      <SearchSpotify spotifyToken={spotifyToken} handleError={setError} targetEntity={'track'} onResultClick={onResultClick} />\n\n      {#if error}\n      <div class=\"error-message\">\n        <div>{error.message}</div>\n        <pre>{error.stack}</pre>\n      </div>\n      {/if}\n    </div>\n\n## Properties\n\n- `spotifyToken`: [A token from the Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)\n- `setError`: A callback that takes an error as an argument. Called if there is an error while searching.\n- `targetEntity`: `track`, `album`. Theoretically, any of the entities accepted by the [Spotify /v1/search endpoint](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/search/search/), though I've only tried track and album so far.\n- `onResultClick`: An event handler that will be passed a result when the user clicks its representative in the DOM. Usually an object that has an `id`, `uri`, and many other properties. See the Response Format in the [search endpoint documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/search/search/) and look at the elements in the `items` arrays in the response examples.\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2020 Jim Kang\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
