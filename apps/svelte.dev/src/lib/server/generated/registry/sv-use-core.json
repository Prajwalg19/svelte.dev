	"readme": "# SvelteUse\n\nA collection of Svelte 5 utilities.\n\n## Features\n\n-   Feature Rich (not exactly *yet*, but we're getting there)\n-   Complete documentation and demos\n-   Strongly-typed with Typescript\n-   Supports Svelte and SvelteKit (even with SSR enabled)\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install @sv-use/core\n```\n\nFor more information and documentation, see the [official website](https://svelte-librarian.github.io/sv-use).\n\n## FAQ\n\n1. Aren't there other libraries that do this already ?  \n   Yes there are. However, most of the libraries haven't transitioned to Svelte 5.\n1. Why use this one instead of [`svecosystem/runed`](https://github.com/svecosystem/runed) (or other libraries) ?\n   1. I wanted to make a library that had a lot of utilities to the level of [vueuse/vueuse](https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse) and/or [streamich/react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use). It's not there yet, but it's slowly growing.\n   1. I'm not a big fan of using the `use` prefix *everywhere*, especially when other verbs could be more descriptive.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThough it's not a 1:1 port, I heavily took inspiration from these libraries to adapt the library for the Svelte ecosystem :\n\n-   [vueuse/vueuse](https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse)\n-   [streamich/react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use)\n-   [svecosystem/runed](https://github.com/svecosystem/runed)\n",
