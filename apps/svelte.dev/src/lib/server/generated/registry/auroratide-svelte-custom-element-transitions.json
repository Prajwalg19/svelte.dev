	"readme": "# Svelte Custom Element Transitions\n\nIt's a [known issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/1825) that Svelte transitions do not work when compiling to custom elements (aka, web components). There's an active [Pull Request](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/5870) which has been around for several months.\n\nHopefully that PR will be merged in the near future. But in case it doesn't, at least you have **@auroratide/svelte-custom-element-transitions**! This tiny module works around the issue by applying the CSS rules directly to the target node with Javascript.\n\n```html\n<script>\n  import { fade } from '@auroratide/svelte-custom-element-transitions'\n</script>\n\n<h1 transition:fade>Hello!</h1>\n```\n\nThis module also provides a higher order function which can make custom transitions work as well.\n\n```js\nimport { forCustomElement } from '@auroratide/svelte-custom-element-transitions'\n\nexport const myTransition = forCustomElement((node, params) => {\n    // ...\n})\n```\n\nSee the **[examples](examples)** for different possible use cases.\n\n> By the way, each example is run as an automated test!\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis library is intended to become deprecated as soon as Svelte has an official solution. In the meantime, here are some helpful notes for anyone who wants to contribute:\n\n* `npm run build`: Build the library\n* `npm test`: Run verification script (in Chrome)\n* `npm run example`: See transitions in action\n",
