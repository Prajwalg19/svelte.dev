Despite the availability of version 4, I believe that the library is not yet ready for production usage and may not be as complete as other existing libraries.\n\nDuring the development period, I encountered some missing requirements and limitations that I was unable to address within the given timeframe. However, I have made significant efforts to upgrade the library as much as possible over the few months.\n\nBy creating a public archive, I aim to provide transparency and ensure that the community is aware of the current status of `proi-ui`. I encourage you to explore alternative libraries that may better suit your needs. For example:\n - [MeltUI](https://github.com/melt-ui/melt-ui)\n - [SkeletonLabs](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton)\n - [CarbonSvelte](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-svelte)\n\nI appreciate your understanding and support as I will stop the development for the time being to focus on helping and contributing to other existing projects that are better suited for production usage. \n\nIt was a great journey and a learning experience for me.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. \nDiscord: specialdoom#8057\n\nThank you,\nspecialdoom\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/specialdoom/proi-ui/blob/main/src/assets/images/thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"thumbnail\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm i --save-dev @specialdoom/proi-ui\n```\n\n## Figma design resource [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1150697835816146933)\n\n## Check out docs [here](https://proi-ui.vercel.app/)\n\n## Check out migration guide [here](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)\n",
