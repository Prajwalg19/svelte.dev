	"readme": "# svelte-subtlecrypto-store\n\nThis module provides an encrypted writable store for Svelte using the Crypto and\nSubtleCrypto APIs.\n\nThis is mainly a proof-of-concept, and is largely based on the documentation\nfound at Mozilla Developer Network Web Docs:\n\n- [Crypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto)\n- [SubtleCrypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto)\n- [Base64](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64)\n\n## Motivation\n\nI'm not a cryptographer. I don't write crypto. They say: don't write crypto, but\nwhen you do, learn why you shouldn't have.\n\nOn top of it, I'm doing it to learn JavaScript and Svelte. This should be enough\nfor you not to use this module for anything else but what is stated in the\nintroduction: a proof-of-concept, or just fun.\n\n## Security details\n\nEncryption is done with AES-256-GCM and key derivation with PBKDF2 with SHA-384.\nThe Salt and Initialization Vector are generated with `Crypto.getRandomValues`.\nThere are only three configurable options:\n\n- The number of iterations for PBKDF2.\n- The length of the salt for PBKDF2.\n- The length of the Initialization Vector for AES-256-GCM.\n\nAll these values have very well documented defaults, and you can override any or\nall of them passing the `opts` parameter. Example:\n\n```\nimport { writable } from 'svelte/store';\nimport { subtleCryptoStore } from 'svelte-subtlecrypto-store';\n\nconst backend = writable('');\nconst store = subtleCryptoStore(window.crypto, backend, 'my super pass', {\n    iterations: 10000,\n    saltLength: 16,\n    ivLength: 64\n});\n```\n\n*NOTE*: these options are very strictly expected to be finite, positive\ninteger values of type `number`. If you supply something like `'16'` or `16.1`\nthat value will be dropped and a default used. Use predefined constants,\nsanitize your input or check the returned `options` member, which contains the\nparameters being used.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nSource code is written in typescript targetting es2016. By then Crypto and\nSubtleCrypto APIs were already available in most major browsers.\n\nCrypto and SubtleCrypto APIs are only available in a\n[Secure Context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts).\nFor browsers, this means that the `Window` or `Worker` have an HTTPS origin, and\nif the window belongs to an `iframe`, then all its ancestors are also delivered\nthrough HTTPS. There are other cases as well, you can read the linked document\nfor more information. At runtime, the global and readonly property\n[isSecureContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/isSecureContext)\ncan be used to easily detect the availability of these features, so if it\nreturns `true` then you should have access to these APIs.\n",
