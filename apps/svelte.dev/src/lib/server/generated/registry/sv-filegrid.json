	"readme": "# Svelte library\n\nEverything you need to build a Svelte library, powered by [`sv`](https://npmjs.com/package/sv).\n\nRead more about creating a library [in the docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/packaging).\n\n## Creating a project\n\nIf you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!\n\n```bash\n# create a new project in the current directory\nnpx sv create\n\n# create a new project in my-app\nnpx sv create my-app\n```\n\n## Developing\n\nOnce you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n\n# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab\nnpm run dev -- --open\n```\n\nEverything inside `src/lib` is part of your library, everything inside `src/routes` can be used as a showcase or preview app.\n\n## Building\n\nTo build your library:\n\n```bash\nnpm run package\n```\n\nTo create a production version of your showcase app:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nYou can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.\n\n> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.\n\n## Publishing\n\nGo into the `package.json` and give your package the desired name through the `\"name\"` option. Also consider adding a `\"license\"` field and point it to a `LICENSE` file which you can create from a template (one popular option is the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)).\n\nTo publish your library to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):\n\n```bash\nnpm publish\n```\n",
