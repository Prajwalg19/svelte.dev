It aims to keep every child element as it is while wrapping with a scrollable container and a navigation.\n\n## Problem It Solves\n\nImages, menus, and buttons can get unmanageable, requiring one to write a separate grid, list, or menus for wider and smaller devices. It solves this issue. You can still stuff all the menus or images in one line by making them scrollable.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis component works seamlessly on any device, including mobile, tablet, or desktop. It efficiently handles various scroll triggers, thanks to its utilization of the [scroll event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/scroll_event),\n\n- Mouse wheels ✨\n- Keyboard arrow events ✨ (Only if mouse is over the container to prevent every instance from listening to this event)\n- Built-in arrows (←/→) ✨\n- Touchevents ✨\n- Version 1.1.0 now supports the drag event on Desktop.\n\nAnd of course, this component is type-safe.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nBasically, everywhere. It works like SwiftUI's `ScrollView` except that it comes with an arrow navigation, which can be hidden with an option. Cards, images, menus, buttons, links, or even album covers and tags. For most cases, it just makes you forget how the web should be designed in terms of responsiveness.\n\nOn the version [[1.2.0]](https://github.com/thingsneverchange/svelte-scrollable-arrow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#120), there was a new event added `reachNearEnd`. This opens the door for the horizontal endless scrolling.\n\n## Demo\n\n <img src=\"https://images.themecloset.pictures/github/scrollable-arrow/preview.gif\" alt=\"Svelte Scrollable Arrow\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n[Try on a website✨ (Click the search input)](https://themecloset.com 'Try on our website').\n\n## Mobile Preview\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"https://images.themecloset.pictures/github/scrollable-arrow/iphone-preview.gif\" alt=\"Svelte Scrollable Arrow\" style=\"max-width:300px\" /></div>\n\n## Responsive\n\nAutomatically hides/shows arrows depending on the container size.\n<img src=\"https://images.themecloset.pictures/github/scrollable-arrow/responsive-preview-2.gif\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install svelte-scrollable-arrow\n```\n\n```javascript\nimport { ScrollableArrow, ScrollableArrowItem } from 'svelte-scrollable-arrow';\n```\n\n## Usage guide\n\nAll you have to do is to wrap each of your images, buttons or texts with `<ScrollableArrowItem></ScrollableArrowItem>` inside the `<ScrollableArrow></ScrollableArrow>` container. Items can be multiple. You can use the loop `{#each}{/each}` block and it may be wise to assign a key for each item.\n\n```html\n<script>\n\timport { ScrollableArrow, ScrollableArrowItem } from 'svelte-scrollable-arrow';\n</script>\n\n<ScrollableArrow>\n\t<ScrollableArrowItem>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<!-- item -->\n\t\t</div>\n\t</ScrollableArrowItem>\n\t<ScrollableArrowItem>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<!-- item -->\n\t\t</div>\n\t</ScrollableArrowItem>\n\t<ScrollableArrowItem>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<!-- item -->\n\t\t</div>\n\t</ScrollableArrowItem>\n\t<ScrollableArrowItem>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<!-- item -->\n\t\t</div>\n\t</ScrollableArrowItem>\n</ScrollableArrow>\n```\n\n## Props for Container (ScrollableArrow)\n\n| Prop               | Type                                                                                                                                                     | Default             | Description                                                                                                                           |\n| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| justifyContent     | `\"start\"⎮\"end\"⎮\"flex-start\"⎮\"flex-end\"⎮\"center\"⎮\"left\"⎮\"right\"⎮\"normal\"⎮\"space-between\"⎮\"space-around\"⎮\"space-evenly\"⎮\"stretch`                          | `\"start\"`           | Basically the same as `justify-content`.

It doesn't handle any other event. You may consider adding the event to your item container, not this component.\n\n| Prop      | Type          | Description                        |\n| --------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| visible   | `CustomEvent` | Fires when the item is visible     |\n| invisible | `CustomEvent` | Fires when the item is not visible |\n\n### Note about the `showArrowByDefault` option.\n\nThis option is enabled by default. If you see the `right arrow` button showing up and disappearing immediately after, it means there are not enough scrollable contents. As it relies on the `onMount` lifecycle, this flickering is inevitable. You can disable it (not completely, but only when there are not enough contents to scroll) with this option. The recommended way is to make it `true` for smaller window sizes such as mobile, or tablets, and `false` for the wider views such as desktop.\n\n## Limitations & Things to do\n\n1. The component does not support custom arrow images, even though you can change the color & size.\n2. You should wrap each item by `<ScrollableArrowItem/>` to make it work and be able to use the API of the component.\n3. The layout may break if the items in the content don't have a fixed size (either width or height)\n4. On Firefox, the `Smooth Scrolling` option may be turned off if you see the scrolling instantly move to another position. This can be fixed in `about:preferences`. On the `Browsers` tab, enable `Smooth Scrolling`.\n5.
