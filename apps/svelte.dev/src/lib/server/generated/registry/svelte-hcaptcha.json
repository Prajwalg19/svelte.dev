	"readme": "# svelte-hcaptcha\n\n## Description\n\nhCaptcha Component Library for SvelteJS.\n\n[hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) is a drop-replacement for reCAPTCHA that protects user privacy, rewards websites, and helps companies get their data labeled.\n\n[Sign up](https://www.hcaptcha.com/signup-interstitial) at hCaptcha to get your sitekey today. **You need a sitekey to use this library**.\n\nThis library is heavily inspired by [react-hcaptcha](https://github.com/hCaptcha/react-hcaptcha) :bowtie:\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install this library via npm with:\n\n`npm install svelte-hcaptcha --save-dev`\n\n## Usage\n\nThe two requirements for usage are the `sitekey` prop and a parent component such as a `<form />`. The component will automatically include and load the hCaptcha API library and append it to the parent component. This is designed for ease of use with the hCaptcha API!\n\nThe `HCaptcha` component dispatches events which you can listen to in the parents;\n * `mount` - the component has been mounted\n * `load` - the hCaptcha API script has successfully loaded\n * `success` - a user has successfully completed an hCaptcha challenge. The payload of this event contains a `token` which can be used to verify the captcha\n * `error` - something went wrong when the user attempted the captcha\n * `close` - the captcha was closed\n\nIf you don't supply the `sitekey` prop, then the component will try and load it from a `window.sitekey` variable. This can be useful e.g. when the component is to be mounted on a synchronously-rendered page, as you can inject the `window.sitekey` variable from a server backend.\n\n### Basic usage\n\n```svelte\n<form>\n  <HCaptcha \n    sitekey={mySitekey} \n    theme={CaptchaTheme.DARK}\n    on:success={handleSuccess}\n    on:error={handleError}\n  />\n</form>\n```\n\nIf you want to be able to **reset** the component (hint: you probably want to do this, for instance, if captcha verification fails), then you'll need to *bind* to it in the parent. The component exposes a `.reset()` method;\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n  let captcha;\n\n  const handleError = () => {\n    captcha.reset();\n  }\n</script>\n\n...\n\n<form>\n  <HCaptcha \n    bind:this={captcha}\n    on:error={handleError}\n  />\n</form>\n```\n\n## Props\n\n| Name     | Values/Type | Required | Default | Description |\n|----------|-------------|----------|---------|-------------|\n|`sitekey` |`String`      |Yes      | `-`     |This is your sitekey, this allows you to load captcha. If you need a sitekey, please visit [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/), and sign up to get your sitekey.|\n|`apihost` |`String`|No|`https://hcaptcha.com`|See enterprise docs.|\n|`hl`|`String`|No|`-`|Forces a specific localization. See [here](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/languages/) for supported language codes.|\n|`reCaptchaCompa`|`Boolean`|No|`null`|Disable drop-in replacement for reCAPTCHA with `false` to prevent hCaptcha from injecting into `window.grecaptcha`.|\n|`theme`|`CaptchaTheme`|No|`CaptchaTheme.LIGHT`|hCaptcha supports a dark mode and a light mode. By default we render the light variant; set to `CaptchaTheme.DARK` to get the dark mode variant.|\n\n## Events\n\n|Event|Params|Description|\n|`success`|`token`|Fires when a user successfully completes a captcha challenge. Contains the token which is required to verify the captcha.|\n|`load`|`-`|Fires when the hCaptcha api script has finished loading.|\n|`mount`|`-`|Fires when the component is mounted.|\n|`close`|`-`|Fires when the captcha is closed by the user (i.e. s/he has not completed it).|\n|`error`|`-`|Fires when hCaptcha encounters an error and cannot continue. If you specify an error callback, you must inform the user that they should retry.|\n\n## Methods\n\n|Method|Description|\n|`reset()`|Reset the current challenge.|\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests, suggestions, comments, critiques, all happily welcome :)\n\nPlease get in touch with the maintainers if you need help or advice to get the project to run.",
