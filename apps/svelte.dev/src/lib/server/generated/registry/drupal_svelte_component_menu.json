The link to view the example should be available in command line output and should look something like  http://localhost:5000. Please note that, in case port 5000 is already busy, it may pick up some other random port and the link would look similar to  http://localhost:57391.\n## Consuming components\n\nYour package.json has a `\"svelte\"` field pointing to `src/index.js`, which allows Svelte apps to import the source code directly, if they are using a bundler plugin like [rollup-plugin-svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/rollup-plugin-svelte) or [svelte-loader](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader) (where [`resolve.mainFields`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-mainfields) in your webpack config includes `\"svelte\"`). **This is recommended.**\n\nFor everyone else, `npm run build` will bundle your component's source code into a plain JavaScript module (`dist/index.mjs`) and a UMD script (`dist/index.js`).",
