Lite version is written in vanilla JavaScript. All versions include\r\n* custom modal backdrop\r\n* custom open/close buttons\r\n* automatic scroll-lock\r\n* automatic backdrop/close buttons\r\n\r\nUnlike the lite version, the standard version exposes granular controls over the modal, as well as more features. The only requirement being that you are using one of the compatible frameworks. Standard version is currently only available for Svelte.\r\n* dynamically render/import components\r\n* lifecycle hooks (before/after open/close)\r\n* exposes close function\r\n* fixed position and sticky position\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThere is nothing out there (..yet) that gets any easier than this.\r\n\r\n* Test out [examples](https://happymodals.com/docs/examples) to see how simple it is.\r\n* [Add Happy Modals](https://happymodals.com/docs/install) in a few simple steps.\r\n* See [how it works](https://happymodals.com/docs/howiw) behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example Code\r\n\r\nThe bare-minimum required to get a modal up and running.\r\n\r\n### Simple Lite Version\r\n    <div class=\"modal-open\"/> \r\n    <div role=\"dialog\"/>\r\n\r\n### Simple Standard Version\r\n    for Svelte\r\n    <Modal>\r\n        <div slot=\"button\"/>\r\n        <div slot=\"modal\"/>\r\n    </Modal>\r\n\r\nSee live examples at: [https://happymodals.com/docs/examples](https://happymodals.com/docs/examples).\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nStart now at [happymodals.com/docs](https://happymodals.com/docs)!\r\n\r\nThere are two different versions of Happy Modals, a lite version and a standard version. You can access any version of the documentation by the \"version\" toggle on the upper-right-hand corner of the website.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for each version is divided into 3 sections:\r\n* [How it Works](https://happymodals.com/docs/howiw)\r\n* [Examples](https://happymodals.com/docs/examples)\r\n* [Installation](https://happymodals.com/docs/install)\r\n\r\nYou can improve it by sending pull requests to [the same repository](https://github.com/byjackli/happymodals).\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nOpen to proposals with crazy changes, expect lengthy discussions. This is a relatively small project, so there are currently no strict templates and rules.\r\n\r\nJust use the following keywords for their respective changes:\r\n* `[DOCS]`\r\n* `[PATCH]`\r\n* `[UPDATE]`\r\n* `[BREAKING]`\r\n\r\nNote that official npm releases abide by [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), see [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for the complete record.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n### [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\r\n\r\nHappy Modals has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to.
