	"readme": "# jitsi-svelte\n\nThis library allows you to easily create your own custom [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/) client, in the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework.\n\nJitsi is a free, open-source, web-based video conferencing app that has a handy library called lib-jitsi-meet. However, there are quite a few intricacies to getting it working well, and if you're writing a Svelte3-based app, there is some additional complexity in getting all of the events to work together.\n\n`jitsi-svelte` simplifies all of this and provides the svelte stores you need to build a web-based video conferencing app. It also provides Svelte components for Audio, and Video, among others. We use it at [Relm](http://www.relm.us) to power our social virtual world.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/screenshot.png\" width=\"350\" alt=\"Simplified Cam/Mic Setup\">\n</div>\n\nWe were inspired by Whereby's intro screen and created what we call the \"Mirror\" component that mimics their UX & design. This `Mirror` can reduce the code you need to write to give a robust setup screen experience for your users.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nSee the `example/` folder for a sample app that uses `jitsi-svelte`.\n\nIn general, you need to create a ConnectionStore via `createConnectionStore` and supply a `JitsiConfig` as the parameter; then, join a conference (at this point, the user will see others who've already entered the room), and use a `Mirror` component to let the user configure their mic and camera before entering the room.\n\n```javascript\nimport { createConnectionStore, DEFAULT_JITSI_CONFIG, Mirror } from 'jitsi-svelte'\n\nimport Conference from './Conference'\n\nconst connection = createConnectionStore(DEFAULT_JITSI_CONFIG, 'jitsi-svelte-test')\n\nconnection.conferences.join('jitsi-svelte-test')\n\n// NEXT: use Mirror svelte component (see SampleApp.svelte)\n```\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n\n# What is Relm?\n\nRelm is a social universe--a kinder, gentler online community. It's an experiment in mixing a game world with work meetings. Come visit sometime! https://www.relm.us\n",
