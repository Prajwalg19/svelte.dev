	"readme": "# Flock-UI\nFlock-UI is a svelte library that provides cookie-cutter components to use for scouting in FRC (FIRST robotics competition).\n\n# Description\nThis library is meant to provide cookie-cutter components with complex behaviors to be used simply. Most components in the library are minimaly styled with the exception of [template components](https://github.com/flamingchickens1540/Flock-UI/tree/main/src/lib/template) and ones that are designated to specific folders as pre-styled components.\n\n## Cookie-Cutter Components\nThe general use of the cookie-cutter components are to provide component functions that make code more readable and concise--It makes svelte code standardized.\n\n## Styled Components\n\"I\" don't suggest using the styled components, because they are meant to be a demonstration on how to use certain components.\n\n# Contribution\nvisit [here](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n\n## Dependencies\nNew libraries or dependencies should not be added unless __absolutely necessary__. Assuming all components will have some triviality, newly installed dependencies will be an extension of that triviality, therefore newly installed dependencies should have an applicable use for most components in the library, if not all. \n\n\nrepo : https://github.com/flamingchickens1540/Flock-UI\n\nnpm : https://www.npmjs.com/package/flock-ui",
