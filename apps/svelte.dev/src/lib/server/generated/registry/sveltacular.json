	"readme": "![Sveltacular](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonbyrne/sveltacular/main/static/sveltacular.png)\n\nSveltacular is TypeScript and SASS based component library for Svelte, with no other dependencies.\n\nWhy did I create it when there are other options? Well, mainly because the best options out there were based on Tailwind. And, no disrespect to those who love it, but I didn't want to use Tailwind. So since I didn't find what I was loooking for, I made my own.\n\n## Run Storybook\n\nI don't have great documentation for now, but you can browse all of the available components by running Storybook locally. Check out the repo and then run this command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run storybook\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall it in your project\n\n```bash\nnpm i sveltacular\n```\n\nThen use it like this:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport { Button } from 'sveltacular';\n</script>\n\n<Button>Hello World</Button>\n```\n",
